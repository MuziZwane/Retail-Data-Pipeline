This repository contains the code and documentation for a robust data pipeline that ingests, transforms, and loads retail data from various sources into a data warehouse. The pipeline is built using popular open-source tools and frameworks, making it scalable and easy to maintain.

## Key Features

- **Data Ingestion**: Supports ingestion from multiple data sources, including CSV files, SQL databases, and APIs.
- **Data Transformation**: Applies a series of transformations to clean, enrich, and standardize the data using Apache Spark.
- **Data Loading**: Loads the transformed data into a data warehouse (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift) for analysis and reporting.
- **Orchestration**: Uses Apache Airflow to orchestrate the end-to-end data pipeline, ensuring reliable and scheduled execution.
- **Monitoring and Alerting**: Implements comprehensive monitoring and alerting to proactively detect and address pipeline issues.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle growing data volumes and adapt to changing business requirements.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Retail Data Pipeline, please follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Install Docker and Docker Compose on your local machine.
   - Ensure you have access to the necessary data sources (e.g., SQL databases, APIs) and a data warehouse (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift).

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/MuziZwane/Retail-Data-Pipeline.git
   cd Retail-Data-Pipeline
   ```

3. **Configure the Pipeline**:
   - Update the `config.py` file with your data source and data warehouse credentials and settings.
   - Customize the data transformation logic in the `transform.py` file to meet your specific requirements.

4. **Deploy the Pipeline**:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   This will start the Airflow webserver and scheduler, as well as the other services required for the pipeline.

5. **Monitor the Pipeline**:
   - Access the Airflow webUI at `http://localhost:8080` and observe the pipeline's execution.
   - Configure email or Slack alerts to receive notifications about pipeline failures or other critical events.
